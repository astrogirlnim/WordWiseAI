  technical: `
    This is a technical document. The API endpoint returns a JSON response with status codes. 
    Dr. Johnson's research shows that 95.5% accuracy can be achieved. The system processes 
    approximately 1,000 requests per second. Figure 3.14 demonstrates the performance metrics. 
    The algorithm uses O(n log n) complexity for sorting operations. Error handling includes 
    HTTP status codes like 200, 404, and 500. The configuration file uses JSON format with 
    nested objects. Database queries use SQL SELECT statements with JOIN operations.

  creative: `
    "Hello!" she exclaimed with excitement. The mysterious forest stretched endlessly before them. 
    Ancient trees whispered secrets in the wind, their branches dancing like ghostly fingers. 
    The protagonist wondered, "What lies beyond?" As darkness fell, strange sounds echoed through 
    the silence. The moon cast eerie shadows on the forest floor. Each step forward brought new 
    discoveries and unknown dangers. The adventure had just begun...

  legal: `
    Section 1.01 defines the terms used herein. The Agreement shall be governed by the laws of 
    the State of California, U.S.A. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, the Parties 
    agree that disputes shall be resolved through binding arbitration. The term "Confidential 
    Information" includes, but is not limited to, trade secrets, proprietary data, and business 
    plans. Each Party represents and warrants that it has full corporate power and authority to 
    enter into this Agreement. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which 
    shall be deemed an original.

  large: `
    This is a large document that should be chunked into multiple pieces to test the chunking algorithm. 
    It contains many sentences with various punctuation marks and formatting. The text includes 
    technical terms, proper nouns, and complex sentence structures. Dr. Smith conducted extensive 
    research on natural language processing. The results showed 99.7% accuracy in parsing capabilities. 
    Machine learning algorithms have revolutionized text processing. Deep learning models can 
    understand context and semantics. Neural networks process information through interconnected nodes. 
    Artificial intelligence systems continue to evolve rapidly. The future of AI looks promising with 
    advances in quantum computing. Researchers are exploring new frontiers in computational linguistics. 
    Natural language understanding requires sophisticated algorithms. Text analysis involves multiple 
    layers of processing including tokenization, parsing, and semantic analysis. Modern systems can 
    handle multiple languages simultaneously. Cross-lingual processing presents unique challenges. 
    Machine translation has improved significantly in recent years. Statistical methods complement 
    neural network approaches. Hybrid systems often achieve the best performance. Data quality 
    remains crucial for training effective models. Large-scale datasets enable better generalization. 
    Computational resources continue to increase exponentially. Cloud computing provides scalable 
    infrastructure for AI applications. Distributed processing enables handling of massive datasets.
