# Real-Time Grammar Check & Text Editor Refactoring Plan

## Executive Summary

The WordWise AI text editor and real-time grammar checking system has evolved into a complex, intertwined architecture that suffers from multiple performance and reliability issues. This document analyzes the current state and provides a comprehensive refactoring plan to address core problems.

## Current State Analysis

### Architecture Overview

The system consists of several tightly coupled components:

1. **Text Editor Core**: TipTap-based editor with custom extensions
2. **Grammar Checking System**: Multi-stage processing with chunking and caching
3. **Document Pagination**: 5000-character page system for large documents
4. **Real-time Synchronization**: Version control and collaboration features
5. **AI Suggestions**: Integrated writing assistance with document modifications

### Key Components & Files

#### Text Editor Stack
- `components/document-editor.tsx` - Main editor component (1,105 lines)
- `components/tiptap-grammar-extension.ts` - Grammar decoration plugin (128 lines)
- `components/document-container.tsx` - Editor orchestration wrapper
- `app/globals.css` - Styling for grammar highlighting and editor themes

#### Grammar Checking System
- `hooks/use-grammar-checker.ts` - Main grammar checking hook (496 lines)
- `services/ai-service.ts` - API service layer for grammar checks
- `utils/text-chunker.ts` - Text chunking utility (406 lines)
- `functions/index.js` - Firebase Cloud Functions for grammar processing
- `types/grammar.ts` - Grammar error type definitions

#### Supporting Systems

- **Cloud Functions**: Grammar checking API endpoints with rate limiting (30 req/min)
- **Realtime Database**: Collaboration and presence system
- **Authentication**: User session management

## Critical Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Non-Smooth Text Input Experience

**Problem**: Users experience interrupted typing flow, text flashing, and unresponsive spacebar.

**Root Causes**:
1. **Multiple Content Update Conflicts**: Pagination system, version sync, and auto-save trigger simultaneous `editor.commands.setContent()` calls
2. **Race Conditions**: Multiple `useEffect` hooks updating editor content without coordination
3. **Missing Debouncing**: No protection against rapid successive content updates during typing
4. **onUpdate Callback Conflicts**: Content update callbacks interfere with user input

**Evidence Found**:
```typescript
// From document-editor.tsx - Multiple BUGFIX comments indicate attempted fixes
// BUGFIX: Prevent recursive updates and reduce flashing
// BUGFIX: Debounce rapid updates to prevent flashing
// BUGFIX: Reset flag after content is set
```

**Affected Files**:
- `components/document-editor.tsx` (Lines 226-261: onUpdate handler)
- `components/document-editor.tsx` (Lines 714-761: Content synchronization)
- `hooks/use-auto-save.ts` (Auto-save triggering content updates)
- `hooks/use-document-versions.ts` (Version restore content updates)

**Architectural Concerns**:
- **Client-side**: Multiple React hooks competing for editor state control
- **TipTap Integration**: Improper use of `setContent()` during user input
- **State Management**: Lack of centralized editor state coordination

### Issue 2: Copy-Paste Styling Contamination

**Problem**: Pasted content retains formatting from source, breaking editor consistency.

**Root Causes**:
1. **Incomplete Paste Processing**: PlainTextPasteExtension doesn't handle all paste scenarios
2. **TipTap Default Behavior**: Rich text preservation is default behavior
3. **Missing Content Sanitization**: No post-paste content cleaning

**Evidence Found**:
```typescript
// From document-editor.tsx - Paste extension implementation
const PlainTextPasteExtension = Extension.create({
  name: 'plainTextPaste',
  // Only handles text/plain clipboard data
  const text = event.clipboardData?.getData('text/plain') || ''
})
```

**Affected Files**:
- `components/document-editor.tsx` (Lines 47-83: PlainTextPasteExtension)
- TipTap configuration in editor initialization
- Potential CSS inheritance issues in `app/globals.css`

**Architectural Concerns**:
- **Client-side**: Insufficient clipboard data processing
- **TipTap Configuration**: Missing content sanitization extensions
- **Content Model**: No format validation after paste operations

### Issue 3: Inefficient & Error-Prone Grammar Service

**Problem**: Grammar checking system is overcomplicated, prone to rate limiting, and unreliable.

**Root Causes**:
1. **Excessive API Calls**: Multiple simultaneous requests triggering rate limits (30 req/min)
2. **Complex Chunking Logic**: Unnecessary text chunking for most documents
3. **Position Mapping Errors**: Frequent text alignment mismatches between chunks and editor
4. **Incomplete Error Handling**: Failed requests cause silent failures

**Evidence Found**:
```typescript
// From hooks/use-grammar-checker.ts - Rate limiting issues
// Phase 6.1: Only processes visible page text to avoid rate limiting
// BUGFIX: Error positions after adjustment
// FirebaseError: Rate limit exceeded and 429 (Too Many Requests)
```

**Affected Files**:
- `hooks/use-grammar-checker.ts` (Complex chunking and position mapping)
- `utils/text-chunker.ts` (Unnecessary complexity for most use cases)
- `services/ai-service.ts` (API layer with insufficient retry logic)
- `functions/index.js` (Rate limiting implementation)
- `components/tiptap-grammar-extension.ts` (Position validation complexity)

**Architectural Concerns**:
- **Server-side**: Firebase Cloud Functions rate limiting conflicts
- **Client-side**: Complex state management across multiple hooks
- **API Design**: Synchronous processing model doesn't scale
