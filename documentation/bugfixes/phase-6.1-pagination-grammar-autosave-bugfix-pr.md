# PR: Phase 6.1 Pagination Grammar, Autosave, and Versioning Bugfixes

## Overview
This PR implements and fixes all outstanding issues from Phase 6.1 of the real-time grammar performance optimization checklist. It addresses critical bugs in grammar checking, autosave/versioning, and user experience for paginated documents in the WordWise AI editor.

## Key Changes

### 1. **Pagination-Scoped Grammar Checking**
- Grammar checks are now scoped to the visible page only, preventing excessive API calls and rate limit errors.
- In-flight grammar checks are cancelled on page change, ensuring only one session runs at a time.
- Session management system added to guarantee no overlapping chunk-processing sessions.
- Enhanced logging throughout the grammar checker and editor for easier debugging.

### 2. **Autosave and Versioning Reliability**
- Fixed a bug where only the current page's content was being saved as the full document, causing version history to show only the latest page.
- Now, every edit (typing or pasting) reconstructs and saves the entire document, ensuring version history always reflects the full document state.
- Added robust debug logs to trace content comparison, version creation, and save triggers.

### 3. **Paste Event Handling**
- Added a `handlePaste` event to the editor container.
- After a paste, grammar checking and autosave/versioning are immediately triggered for the full document.
- Ensures pasted content is always checked and saved, matching the behavior for typing.

### 4. **UI/UX Improvements**
- Added a "Full Document Check" button for power users, with a warning about rate limits.
- Improved error-to-editor sync and logging for TipTap grammar decorations.
- Fixed editor content reset bug by removing stale dependencies in synchronization effect.

## Rationale
- Ensures robust, scalable grammar checking for large/paginated documents.
- Guarantees that version history and autosave always reflect the true state of the document, regardless of how edits are made.
- Improves user experience and reliability for all editing workflows, including typing, pasting, and page navigation.

## Files Changed
- `hooks/use-grammar-checker.ts`
- `components/document-editor.tsx`
- `components/tiptap-grammar-extension.ts`
- `hooks/use-documents.ts`
- `hooks/use-document-versions.ts`
- `documentation/real-time-grammar-performance-optimization-checklist.md`

---

## Testing
- Manual testing with large documents, rapid edits, and copy-paste workflows.
- Confirmed version history, grammar checking, and autosave all work as expected for both typing and pasting.
- Verified that only the visible page is checked for grammar by default, with an option for full document check.

## Status
**Phase 6.1 is now fully implemented and all known bugs are resolved.**
