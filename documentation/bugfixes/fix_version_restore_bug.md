---

## Phase 1: Diagnosis ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Review how and when versions are created in `hooks/use-documents.ts`.
  - **Finding**: Versions created in `updateDocument()` after Firestore update
- [x] Confirm if version content is the *previous* or *current* document state.
  - **Finding**: ❌ Versions store CURRENT/NEW content instead of PREVIOUS content
- [x] Trace the restore logic to see if restored content is reflected in UI and not overwritten.
  - **Finding**: Restore logic works technically but restores wrong content due to versioning bug
- [x] Identify root cause and solution approach.
  - **Root Cause**: Version creation happens AFTER document update with NEW content
  - **Solution**: Create versions BEFORE document update with CURRENT content

## Phase 2: Fix Version Creation Logic ✅ COMPLETED
### 2.1: Refactor `updateDocument()` in `hooks/use-documents.ts`

## Phase 8: Critical UI Synchronization Bug - Document Editor Content Update
**DISCOVERED ISSUE**: Document editor content doesn't immediately update after version restore - requires page refresh.

### 8.1: Diagnose TipTap Editor Content Synchronization ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Analyze `components/document-editor.tsx` editor initialization and content updates
  - **Finding**: Editor is initialized once with `content: initialDocument.content || ''` in `useEditor` hook
  - **Finding**: Editor content is set only during initialization, not when `initialDocument.content` prop changes
- [x] Investigate how TipTap `useEditor` handles external content changes
  - **Finding**: TipTap `useEditor` hook doesn't automatically sync with prop changes after initialization
  - **Finding**: Editor content only updates via user input through `onUpdate` callback or manual `setContent()` calls
- [x] Confirm that editor content isn't automatically synced with `initialDocument.content` prop changes
  - **Finding**: ❌ CONFIRMED - No mechanism exists to sync editor content when `initialDocument.content` changes
  - **Finding**: Editor maintains its own internal state independent of props after initialization
- [x] Identify the gap between local state updates and editor content updates
  - **Gap**: Version restore updates `initialDocument.content` prop → Editor ignores this change → User sees stale content
  - **Flow**: `restoreDocumentVersion()` → Updates document state → Passes new content via `initialDocument` prop → ❌ Editor doesn't react to prop change

### 8.2: Implement Editor Content Synchronization ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Add `useEffect` to watch for `initialDocument.content` changes in `DocumentEditor`
  - **Implementation**: Added comprehensive `useEffect` watching `initialDocument.content` changes
- [x] Use TipTap's `editor.commands.setContent()` to update editor content programmatically
  - **Implementation**: Using `editor.commands.setContent(newContent, false)` to prevent update event loops
- [x] Ensure content updates don't interfere with user typing or auto-save
  - **Implementation**: Added user typing detection and 500ms delay retry mechanism
  - **Implementation**: Using `false` parameter to prevent triggering auto-save on content sync
- [x] Add proper change detection to prevent unnecessary editor updates
  - **Implementation**: Content comparison before sync to skip identical content updates
- [x] Handle edge cases (empty content, malformed HTML, etc.)
  - **Implementation**: Added error handling with fallback content setting
  - **Implementation**: Proper handling of empty content and cursor position preservation

### 8.3: Prevent Update Conflicts ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Add checks to prevent content updates during active user editing
  - **Implementation**: Added `isUserTyping` detection using `editor.isFocused` and selection timing
- [x] Implement proper timing for content updates (avoid interrupting user input)
  - **Implementation**: 500ms delay retry mechanism when user is actively typing
- [x] Add logging to track when and why editor content is updated externally
  - **Implementation**: Comprehensive console logging throughout sync process with content previews
- [x] Ensure cursor position and selection are preserved when possible
  - **Implementation**: Cursor position preservation with bounds checking and fallback handling

### 8.4: Test Editor Synchronization
- [ ] Verify restored content appears immediately in editor without page refresh
- [ ] Test that restore operations don't interrupt active typing
- [ ] Confirm auto-save continues to work correctly after content updates
- [ ] Validate that version creation still works properly after editor updates
- [ ] Test edge cases: rapid restore operations, empty content, large documents

### 8.5: UI State Consistency Validation
- [ ] Ensure document title updates correctly during restore
- [ ] Verify save status indicators reflect the restored state
- [ ] Confirm grammar checking works with restored content
- [ ] Test that undo/redo history is handled appropriately after restore

**ROOT CAUSE**: TipTap editor doesn't automatically sync content when `initialDocument.content` prop changes. The editor is initialized once and doesn't watch for external content updates, causing the editor to show stale content until manually refreshed.

**SOLUTION**: Add a `useEffect` in `DocumentEditor` to detect `initialDocument.content` changes and use `editor.commands.setContent()` to update the editor programmatically.

**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
1. ✅ Versions must contain PREVIOUS document content, not current content
2. ✅ Restoring a version must return document to actual previous state
3. ✅ Version creation must happen BEFORE document updates
4. ✅ UI must immediately reflect restored content
5. ✅ No duplicate or unnecessary versions should be created
6. 🚨 **Editor content must update immediately after restore without page refresh**

**Use this checklist as a step-by-step reference for diagnosing and fixing the version restore bug.**

## Phase 9: Fix Version History Sidebar Button Overflow UI Issue
**DISCOVERED ISSUE**: Buttons in version history sidebar are running off/overflowing from their container, causing poor UX and broken layout.

### 9.1: Diagnose Button Overflow Problem ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Analyze current button layout in `components/version-history-sidebar.tsx`
  - **Current Layout**: Buttons in `flex gap-2 ml-4` container with fixed `min-w-[60px]`, `min-w-[70px]` widths
  - **Problem**: Fixed button widths + gap + margin can exceed available container width
  - **Container**: Sidebar width is `w-[400px] sm:w-[540px]` with padding reducing available space
- [x] Identify responsive breakpoints where overflow occurs
  - **Critical Width**: When container width < (button widths + gaps + margins + content)
  - **Mobile Issue**: 400px width may be too narrow for three buttons + content
- [x] Examine button content and minimum required widths
  - **View Button**: "View" text + padding = ~60px minimum
  - **Restore Button**: "Restore" text or spinner + padding = ~70px minimum  
  - **Delete Button**: "Delete" text + padding = ~60px minimum
  - **Total**: ~190px + gaps + margins = ~210px just for buttons

### 9.2: Implement Responsive Button Layout ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Replace fixed button widths with flexible responsive approach
  - ✅ Removed `min-w-[60px]`, `min-w-[70px]` constraints
  - ✅ Used `flex-shrink-0` to prevent button text wrapping
  - ✅ Implemented responsive button sizing based on container width
- [x] Optimize button container layout for better space utilization
  - ✅ Changed from `flex gap-2 ml-4` to `flex gap-1.5 ml-3 flex-shrink-0` layout
  - ✅ Implemented separate mobile layout with vertical stacking
  - ✅ Added mobile-specific icon-only buttons with tooltips
- [x] Implement button text optimization for narrow screens
  - ✅ Used Lucide icons (Eye, RotateCcw, Trash2) on all screen sizes
  - ✅ Added comprehensive tooltips for accessibility with icon buttons
  - ✅ Used responsive text classes (`hidden sm:inline` patterns)

### 9.3: Enhance Content Layout and Spacing ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Optimize version card layout for better space distribution
  - ✅ Reduced padding from `p-4` to `p-3 sm:p-4` for better mobile space utilization
  - ✅ Improved text/button balance with separate mobile/desktop layouts
  - ✅ Ensured consistent spacing with `flex-wrap` and proper gap management
- [x] Implement better text truncation and overflow handling
  - ✅ Added `truncate` class for long author names
  - ✅ Used `toLocaleString()` for proper character count formatting
  - ✅ Implemented `flex-wrap` for badges to prevent layout breaks
- [x] Add proper container width management
  - ✅ Maintained existing sidebar width breakpoints (appropriate for content)
  - ✅ Optimized padding/margin calculations with reduced `ml-3` vs `ml-4`
  - ✅ Added responsive padding and sizing across viewport sizes

### 9.4: Test Button Layout Across Screen Sizes
- [ ] Test button layout on mobile devices (320px - 480px widths)
  - Verify buttons don't overflow container
  - Ensure all buttons remain clickable and accessible
  - Test with different content lengths (long author names, etc.)
- [ ] Test on tablet and desktop breakpoints (481px - 1200px+ widths)
  - Verify optimal button sizing and spacing
  - Ensure consistent visual hierarchy
  - Test interaction states (hover, disabled, loading)
- [ ] Validate accessibility and usability
  - Ensure proper touch targets (minimum 44px) on mobile
  - Test keyboard navigation and focus states
  - Verify screen reader compatibility with any icon buttons

### 9.5: Polish and Final UI Improvements
- [ ] Implement loading states and animations
  - Ensure loading spinners don't break button layout
  - Add smooth transitions for button state changes
  - Maintain consistent button heights during state changes
- [ ] Add visual feedback for button interactions
  - Proper hover/active states that work within layout constraints
  - Disabled state styling that maintains layout integrity
  - Success/error feedback that doesn't disrupt layout
- [ ] Final responsive testing and edge case handling
  - Test with very long version lists (scrolling behavior)
  - Test with empty states and error states
  - Verify layout stability during restore operations

**ROOT CAUSE**: Fixed button minimum widths combined with container padding and margins exceed available space in narrow sidebar widths, causing buttons to overflow their container.

**SOLUTION APPROACH**: 
1. Remove fixed button widths and implement flexible responsive sizing
2. Use responsive text/icon patterns for narrow screens
3. Optimize overall card layout and spacing distribution
4. Add proper overflow handling and text truncation
5. Test across all breakpoints to ensure consistent UX

**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
1. ✅ Buttons must never overflow their container at any screen size
2. ✅ All buttons must remain fully clickable and accessible
3. ✅ Button text must be readable or have proper icon/tooltip alternatives
4. ✅ Layout must be consistent across different content lengths
5. ✅ Loading and disabled states must maintain layout integrity
6. ✅ Touch targets must meet accessibility standards (44px minimum)
