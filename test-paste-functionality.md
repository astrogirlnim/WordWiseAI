# Paste Functionality Fix Test

## Problem Statement
The version history auto-save feature was working for typed text but not for copy-pasted text.

## Root Cause
The original implementation only had a `handlePaste` function attached to the outer container div, but TipTap's internal paste handling doesn't always bubble up to the container level.

## Solution Implemented
1. Created a new `PasteExtension` for TipTap that hooks directly into the editor's paste events
2. Updated `DocumentEditor` to use this extension
3. Used a ref-based callback system to avoid circular dependencies

## Files Modified
- `components/tiptap-paste-extension.ts` - NEW: TipTap extension for paste handling
- `components/document-editor.tsx` - Updated to use the new paste extension

## How to Test

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Open a document in the editor
3. Test typing some text - should auto-save and create versions
4. Test copy-pasting text from another source:
   - Copy text from another application
   - Paste it into the editor (Ctrl+V or right-click > Paste)
   - Check that auto-save triggers and versions are created
5. Check version history to verify both typed and pasted content creates versions

### Expected Behavior
- Both typed and pasted text should trigger auto-save
- Version history should show versions for both types of content changes
- Console logs should show paste events being detected

### Debug Information
Look for these console messages:
- `[PasteExtension] Paste event detected in TipTap editor`
- `[DocumentEditor] handlePasteCallback: Paste detected via TipTap extension`
- `[DocumentEditor] handlePasteCallback: Full content updated. Length: X`

## Technical Details

### PasteExtension Implementation
The extension uses ProseMirror's `handlePaste` hook to intercept paste events at the editor level, ensuring all paste operations are captured regardless of how they're initiated.

### Callback System
Uses a ref-based callback system to avoid circular dependencies between the editor initialization and the paste handler.

### Content Reconstruction
After paste, the extension reconstructs the full document content (for paginated documents) and triggers both auto-save and grammar checking.

## Rollback Plan
If issues arise, the `PasteExtension` can be removed from the editor extensions and the old container-level `handlePaste` can be restored.
