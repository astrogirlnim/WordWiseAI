# Test: Version History Auto-Save for Copy-Pasted Text in Fresh Documents

## Issue Description
Version history wasn't creating versions when text was copy-pasted into fresh (new/empty) documents, even though it worked correctly for typed text and paste operations in existing documents.

## Root Cause
The version creation logic in `hooks/use-documents.ts` required "meaningful previous content" (`currentContentTrimmed.length > 0`), which prevented version creation for fresh documents where the previous content was empty.

## Fix Implemented
1. **Enhanced Version Creation Logic**: Modified the logic to create baseline "empty state" versions for fresh documents when they receive their first content
2. **Enhanced Paste Handler Logging**: Added comprehensive logging to track paste operations and ensure they're working correctly

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Fresh Document Paste Test
1. Create a new document (it starts empty)
2. Copy some text and paste it into the editor
3. **Expected Result**: 
   - A version should be created with the empty state as baseline
   - The pasted content should be saved automatically
   - Version history should show the baseline version for rollback

### Existing Document Paste Test  
1. Open an existing document with content
2. Copy some text and paste it
3. **Expected Result**:
   - A version should be created with the previous content
   - The pasted content should be saved automatically
   - Version history should show the previous version for rollback

## Log Messages to Look For

### Fresh Document Paste Logs
```
[DocumentEditor] handlePaste: Paste event detected
[DocumentEditor] handlePaste: Current document state - fullContentHtml length: 0
[updateDocument] Content update detected, processing version creation...
[updateDocument] isFreshDocument: true
[updateDocument] Creating version: Initial empty state (baseline version)
[updateDocument] Version content length: 0
[updateDocument] Version created successfully with ID: [version-id]
[updateDocument] Version type: baseline (empty)
```

### Existing Document Paste Logs
```
[DocumentEditor] handlePaste: Paste event detected  
[DocumentEditor] handlePaste: Current document state - fullContentHtml length: [content-length]
[updateDocument] Content update detected, processing version creation...
[updateDocument] isFreshDocument: false
[updateDocument] Creating version: Previous content before update
[updateDocument] Version content length: [previous-content-length]
[updateDocument] Version created successfully with ID: [version-id]
[updateDocument] Version type: previous content
```

## Test Steps
1. Open the app in development mode
2. Open browser console to see logs
3. Create a new document
4. Paste some text (e.g., the sample text from `test-files/text-chunker-test.js`)
5. Check version history - should show a baseline version
6. Verify you can revert to the empty baseline version
